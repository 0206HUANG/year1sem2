Reflection: The experience in the PC Assemble (Lab) allowed me to physically assemble a computer, and it also enlightened me about the complexity and precision of computer hardware. I realized that the absence of even a single PC component can prevent the system from functioning. These components made me clearly understand how they work together to ensure the efficient operation of a computer. In summary, this hands-on experience deepened my understanding of the importance of theoretical knowledge and practical application.
