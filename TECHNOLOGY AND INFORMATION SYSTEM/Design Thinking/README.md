Through Design Thinking, I have learned a multitude of
valuable knowledge and skills that are immensely
important for my personal and professional development.
Firstly, the course taught us how to customize software
according to customer needs. This process is not just
about technical implementation, but also a challenge to
our social skills. We learned to conduct thorough
investigations into user needs and preferences, which
helps us understand our target user groups. By analyzing
the user interfaces of other software, we learned how to
design interfaces that are both appealing and meet user
needs. This experience has profoundly made me realize
that the success of a software product relies not only on
technological innovation but more importantly on a deep
understanding of User Experience. This emphasis on UX
not only improves product quality but also has directed the
path for my future career. During this process, I also
recognized the importance of teamwork. We need to work
collaboratively, integrating each person's ideas and skills
into the project, to create superior software solutions. In
the future, I plan to further strengthen my teamwork
abilities and technical knowledge so as to develop truly
excellent software products. This Design Thinking course
has not only enhanced my technical capabilities but also
helped me build effective team collaboration and a deep
understanding of user needs, which is undoubtedly a great
asset to my career
