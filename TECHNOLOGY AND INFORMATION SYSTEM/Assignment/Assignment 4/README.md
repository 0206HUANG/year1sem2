Reflection: After attending the industrial lecture by Credence, I gained new insights into a comprehensive understanding of system development. The lecture made me profoundly aware that becoming a successful system developer requires not only excellent programming skills but also strong soft skills, such as teamwork, effective communication, and time management. Seeing my teammates' reflections, I became even more aware of how to become an outstanding individual. Regarding how to effectively integrate data in business analysis and data engineering, as well as how to transform this data into practical business insights, I gained valuable insights. I realized the importance of keeping my knowledge up-to-date in the ever-changing field of technology and am determined to combine theoretical knowledge with practical experience to meet the demands of the industry. By planning my learning path and career goals, I believe I can succeed in this challenging and opportunistic field.
