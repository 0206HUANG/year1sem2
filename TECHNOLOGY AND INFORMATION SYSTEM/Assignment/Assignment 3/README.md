Reflection: Through our visit to UTM Digital and the Virtual talk, we profoundly realized the importance of big data in our lives. This experience not only allowed us to see the application of big data across various fields but also demonstrated its multifunctionality and omnipresence. Big data is more than just a pile of numbers; it is a dynamically evolving entity that influences decision-making, guides trends, and deeply permeates our daily lives. Its real-time impact on our lives, from consumer behavior to social interactions, is evident everywhere. This visit made it clearer that to stand firm in this data-driven era, it is essential to understand and harness the power of big data.
